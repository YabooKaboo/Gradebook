gradebook
=========

Gradebook for standards-based grading, written in Python.

Requires [MultiMarkDown][MMD], [LaTeX][latex] (Mac users go [here][mac]), and the [MMD templates for LaTeX][temp].

Includes the module (gradebook.py), a script for generating student reports (reports.py), a template for student data files (studentTemplate.csv), and a few sample students just for fun. 

I have posted [a video introduction][vimeo] to this application that demonstrates what it can do and how to use it.

Please feel free to email or tweet me (@krisshaffer) with feedback or feature requests!
